# Class Imbalance

Code to solve class imbalance problem using an iterative approach. 

Datasets: Some datasets are chosen from the UCI, Keel and LIBSVM repositories. They are preprocessed using [preprocess.py](preprocess.py) and kept in data folder.

[topn.py](topn.py): Code for our method.

[classifier.py](classifier.py): Code to compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods.

# How to Run

The dataset name can be updated in [topn.py](topn.py) and it can be executed for results to be displayed for that dataset. 

For comparing our results with state-of-the-art, the same dataset name can be updated in [classifier.py](classifier.py) and it can be executed for a comparison.
